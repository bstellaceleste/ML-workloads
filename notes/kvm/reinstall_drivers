#follow the procedure on https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux
sudo dpkg -i ../cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y cuda

# if after all installations you still get "NVIDIA-SMI has failed because it couldn't communicate with the NVIDIA driver. Make sure that the latest NVIDIA driver  is installed and running", do the following:
sudo apt install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
sudo apt install dkms
dkms status nvidia to check everything and if not yet installed: sudo dkms install -m nvidia -v #version

#after rebooting you can get this: "docker: Error response from daemon: could not select device driver "" with capabilities: [[gpu]].", then do this:
sudo apt install --reinstall -y nvidia-docker2
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker


Uninstall what is already in place
run cuda-installer wherever cuda is installed (normally under /usr/local/cuda-xx.x/bin)
If modified the driver run nvidia-uninstall
Install the lastest
cd /
sudo sh cuda_12.5.1_555.42.06_linux.run
Select everything minus the Kernel Objects and the Driver if the driver has not been modified
